### Markdown Installer

Before we start installing all the dependacies for Playwright, i've added in this section for installing Markdown. The layout of Markdown makes it easier for the "readme" to be followed and understood

##### Installing the Markdown extenstion.

- Searrch and download the markdown installer from the extenstions view.

3. Install dependencies in VS code

   - in VS code open a terminal and run:

     - npm install

   - To be able to run the code across different environments run:

     - npm i dotenv --save-dev
     - npm i cross-env --save-dev

   - Next, add .env.uat and .env.preprod files to the root directory and populate them with the data held in the relevant file in LastPass under the Playwright-QA directory.
