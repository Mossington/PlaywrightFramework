## Dependencies

<br>

##### Install dependencies in VS code

First check if you have Nodejs and NPM installed. To do this, type inthe following command in the terminal

- Check version of npm installed: npm --version

  - If the npm package isnt install, from the terminal type in: npm install
  - Note, this is the node packages installer that gets installed along with node

- Check Version of node installed: node --version
  - If node is not installed, navigate to: nodejs.org/en/download/ and download the correct version for your operating system
  - Once installed, open a new command window and type in: node --version

<br>

##### Install playwright with Typescript

NOTE: the below is required for each Playwright project created

To install playwight from the visual studio extensionsm, navigate to:

- View menu > Command Palette

  - <img src="Playwright install image 1.png" alt="Sample Image" width="500" height="140">

<br>

  - <img src="Playwright install image browsers Download.png" alt="Sample Image" width="500" height="150">
  - Note, as you can see from the screenshot, Playwright is installed using the Typescript language by deafult, if you wish to use JavsScript instead, ensure you check the box.

<br>

- Click "ok" and navigate through the install process.

<br>

##### Updating the version of playwright

To update Playwright to the latest version run the following command:

- npm install -D @playwright/test@latest

<br>

Also download new browser binaries and their dependencies:

- npx playwright install --with-deps

<br>

##### Updating depandant packages

For each new playwright project, to ensure the latest packages are installed, in VS code open a terminal and run:

- npm install

<br>

##### Environment Management

To be able to run the code across different environments run:

- npm i dotenv --save-dev
  - Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env.

<br>

- npm i cross-env --save-dev
  - cross-env makes it so you can have a single command without worrying about setting or using the environment variable properly for the platform

<br>

##### Creating the .env.xxxx file - environment varibles

Next, add .env.uat and .env.preprod files to the root directory and populate them with the relevant test data:

###### DB_CONNECTION=

###### DB_USERNAME=

###### DB_PASSWORD=

###### ENV_URL=

###### API_URL=

###### BEARER_TOKEN=

- NOTE: The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request. The client must send this token in the Authorization header when making requests to protected resources: 1. Authorization: Bearer
